# folder-graph-link.
The **Folder Graph Link** plugin for Obsidian automatically creates and manages folder notes, linking all notes within a folder to their parent folder note. It dynamically updates links when notes are moved between folders and hides folder notes from the file explorer for a cleaner interface. Simplify folder management!
